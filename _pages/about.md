I am a PhD candidate in Economics. I am on the job market 2018-2019 academic year. I will be available for the interviews at the ASSA Meeting in Atlanta and at the EEA Job Market Meeting in Naples. 

My research is on the intersection of Public Economics, Industrial Organization, and Labor Economics. In particular, I study the optimal design in unemployment insurance, the role of a structure of inheritance and wealth taxes, and the effect of goverment regulations in college and housing markets.

I was a visiting scholar at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (2017-2018) and at the University of Oxford (2015). I was also a consultant for International Labour Organisation during 2016-2017.

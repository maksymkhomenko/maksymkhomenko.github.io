My research is on the intersection of Public Economics, Industrial Organization, and Labor Economics. In particular, I study the optimal design in unemployment insurance, the role of a structure of inheritance and wealth taxes, and the effect of government regulations in college and housing markets. I am also interested more broadly in design of insurance markets and regulations of a use of consumer-generated data.

I was a visiting scholar at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (2017-2018) and at the University of Oxford (2015). I was also a consultant for International Labour Organisation during 2016-2017.

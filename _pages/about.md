Welcome to my website!

My research is on the intersection of Public Economics, Industrial Organization, and Labor Economics. In particular, I study the optimal design in unemployment insurance, the role of a structure of inheritance and wealth taxes, and the effect of government regulations in college and housing markets, determinants of private financial and investment choices, markets for innovations and patents, and application of reinforcement learning methods to estimation of games.

I was a visiting scholar at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (2017-2018) and at the University of Oxford (2015). I was also a consultant for International Labour Organisation during 2016-2017.

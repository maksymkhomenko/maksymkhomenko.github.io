I am a PhD candidate in Economics. I am on the job market 2018-2019 academic year. I will be available for the interviews on January 4-6, 2019 at the ASSA Meeting in Atlanta, USA and on December 6-7, 2018 at the European Job Market, in Naples, Italy.  {: style="text-align: justify;"}

My research interests are primarily on the intersection of Public Economics, Industrial Organization, and Labor Economics. The first line of my research focuses on the optimal design of public policies. In particular, I study optimal regulations in unemployment insurance, college markets and a design of inheritance taxation. Another line of my research is related to market determinants of inequality. In particular, I study the role of housing markets in spatial inequality and the welfare costs of inequality as a result of equilibrium price distortion and misallocation in markets.  {: style="text-align: justify;"}

I was a visiting PhD scholar at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (2017 - 2018) and at the University of Oxford (2015). I was also a consultant for International Labour Organisation during 2016 - 2017 within the project aimed at understanding and improving policies aimed at entrepreneurship and labor markets in South America.  {: style="text-align: justify;"}

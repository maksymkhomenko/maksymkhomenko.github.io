* [**Private Information and Design of Unemployment Insurance**](https://khomenkomaks.com/files/JMP-October2018v2.pdf), *job market paper*

Unemployment insurance (UI) programs around the world are predominantly government-provided with universal coverage. One explanation for the dominant adoption of mandatory UI is that private knowledge about unemployment risks might lead to a selected pool of insured individuals and generate welfare losses. At the same time, mandates might have a detrimental effect on welfare because of fully restricted individual choices. This ambiguity motivates a need to consider alternative designs of UI that allow for the individual choice but restrict selection into insurance based on risks. I use institutional features of the Swedish voluntary UI system and detailed administrative data to study the optimal design of UI. To evaluate welfare under various alternative regulations, I estimate a structural model of insurance choice that captures heterogeneity in preferences and private information about future unemployment risks. The results suggest that mandating UI would unambiguously reduce welfare by on average 49% in terms of consumer surplus compared to a current system. In contrast, appropriate designs with voluntary enrollment generate large welfare gains. In particular, contracts with fixed enrollment timing and predetermined duration improve welfare by 58% - 95% in terms of the consumer surplus. A "two-part tariff" contract that fails to sufficiently restrict risk-based selection results in average consumer surplus loss of 3%.

# SELECTED WORK IN PROGRESS

* **Determinants of University Competition and Student Demand in Higher Education: Evidence from Australia**, *with Natalie Bachas*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We exploit detailed administrative data from an Australian college admission center and exogenous &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variation in tuitions fees. Firstly, we show that students’ choices are affected by price changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we present evidence that universities use admission thresholds to compete for a number and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality of admitted students. We estimate a model of college demand and university competition to study &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the determinants of student demand, university competition and consequences of government interventions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in college markets. The findings suggest that price regulations result in different outcomes compared &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to direct admission regulations. Because of the strategic behavior of universities, pricing policies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might lead to segregation by the quality of students or by socio-economic status. Both effects might be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewed as undesirable consequences of government interventions, which fundamentally depend on a joint &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution of student characteristics and distributional preferences.
